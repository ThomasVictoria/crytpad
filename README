Example: If you allocate 50 GiB total for CryptPad persistent storage, you might do:

Datastore: ~ 20 GiB (40%)

Blob: ~ 15–17 GiB (30–35%)

Block: ~ 8–10 GiB (16–20%)

Archive / logs: ~ 5-7 GiB (10–14%)



A reasonable starting prorata (in %) is roughly 35–40% for datastore, 30–35% for blob, 15–20% for block, and 10–15% for archive / logs, but you should adapt based on expected usage and monitor real usage.
